# Melanoma Detection Project

> This project aims to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting melanoma and other skin conditions using the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset. The dataset contains 2,357 images categorized into nine classes:

-Actinic keratosis
-Basal cell carcinoma
-Dermatofibroma
-Melanoma
-Nevus
-Pigmented benign keratosis
-Seborrheic keratosis
-Squamous cell carcinoma
-Vascular lesion
